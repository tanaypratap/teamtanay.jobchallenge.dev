**Note:** This is advisable. Please do this so that you open more doors for you.

Few ways to do it.

- If you’re a beginner, start with posting about your journey and how it all started.

- Then start sharing every small thing you learned about anything. Use more famous social media sites like Twitter, Instagram, Linkedin and Facebook. Share it among your peers. Eventually, you’ll get better at it.

- Let me give you a few examples. Say you completed the UI of your app, take screenshots of it and post it. Completed a course? Post it. Completed back-end? Post it.
- Say you did a course on Firebase, you can write a post saying, "Wow! Finally completed the firebase course, the docs are pretty basic, to be an expert one must try hands on with the library". Here, you shared your journey and your learning.

Basically, celebrate your small wins. Share what you learned, and what obstacles you faced while completing the challenge. Posts like these will get re-shared and you'll get extra visibility. If you consistently write good posts, you’ll earn extra marks.
