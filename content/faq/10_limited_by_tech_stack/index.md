Challenge is open but not limited to any stack. However, my suggestion would be to go with React and React Native. Getting a job is much easier with React stack.

With React/React Native, you’re more likely to get the interviews as my network has more React/React Native/Node.js openings. So there’s a high chance to get a job interview/offer when you get a shout-out from my network handles and when the hiring partners want to interview you.

This also could be a great opportunity for you to learn a new framework/library.
Although, you can choose the framework/library/stack of your choice. The only difference is that you might not get as many interview offers, since the demand from me is not that great. So, choose wisely.
