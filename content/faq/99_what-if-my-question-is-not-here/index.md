Please follow the steps if your question is not answered here:

1. Check really well. If your question is a duplicate and is already answered it will be counted as a negative point.

2. Go to the repository for [this website](https://github.com/tanaypratap/teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev/issues). See all the issues. Do you see a question similar to yours? If yes, upvote it. Or comment for additional info. Again, do check before posting.

3. If you don't find any related issue/question then please [create a fresh issue](https://github.com/tanaypratap/teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev/issues/new). Make sure that you make the question generic enough so that it can be used by other people.

4. You can also join the telegram group https://t.me/teamtanay for discussions.

_Note_ Failure to check for duplicates mean that you don't pay attention to details and instructions. I wouldn't recommend a person like that to anyone personally. Understand that this is a massive free project. Intention to help will be appreciated. Entitlement would not be tolerated.
