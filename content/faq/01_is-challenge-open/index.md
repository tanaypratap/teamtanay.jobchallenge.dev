Yes! This participation is open for everyone. It is also _free_.
College freshers who are looking for a job, or working professionals with less than 2 years of work experience who are looking for a job change, anyone can participate.
Students who are passing 12th grade and joining colleges can get remote work internship too.
On top of that, the participants do not have to pay anything in order to participate in the challenge. You just need to put your honest effort.
