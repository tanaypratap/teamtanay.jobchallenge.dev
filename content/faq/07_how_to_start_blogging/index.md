It's a good idea to get your own blog on your own domain. And then cross post on all other platforms. But it’s too much of a hassle if you’re a beginner.

There are various platforms to get started with blogging like. My preference would be in this order:

- [dev.to](https://dev.to/),
- [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
- [hashnode](https://hashnode.com/)
- or [medium](https://medium.com/), .

So what you can do instead is: post it on any of the platforms mentioned above, wait for 2-4 days, and then cross post it on other platforms as well. Use your social media handles to publicize it. Check [this article](https://www.semrush.com/blog/cross-posting-on-social-media-should-you-do-it/) on cross posting if you're serious about blogging. For this competition however, you don't need to do so much. Just get few blogs published.
