**Short answer: No!**
Long answer: No, it won't be considered for the top 5 prizes. Winners for this challenge have to make 5 new projects, 3 new blogs and get 2 reviews in this challenge period only.

However, we have hiring partners who might be going through all the challengers' profile. So, do showcase your previous projects on your portfolio to increase your chances of getting an interview.

I would advise that if you have previous projects to showcase and you can't actively participate in the challenge, you still register to get eyeballs of our hiring partners. You never know who invites you for an interview. _Participation is the key!_
