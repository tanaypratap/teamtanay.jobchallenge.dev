This feels like just happened yesterday or few days before but we have crossed almost three months and the challenge ends on 30th June, 2020.

So first thing Kudos that you have achieved the milestone of 5.3.2, I am sure you all have learn and built new connections through the challenge.

Now how can one update his/her data if he has completed the challenge, so let me walk through the steps involved:  

- First you need to update your 5 projects, 3 blogs, and raise an issue for review and update your index.md file by raising a **PR**, after that when **PR** gets accepted you need to follow:
- Process remains the same you need to generate a **PR** but this time in a different directory which is `finalist` directory.
- Change your directory name as **`ttjc@finalist@username`** .

- Just copy your directory that is ttjc@username inside the `finalist` directory and simply have to do an **Alohomora** any Harry Potter fan? 
  - i.e change the type to **finalist** inside your `index.md` file

  - Add **`image-link`** as follows:

- After that you are good to go!
- Create a **PR** as you did before, boom you are done.  
- **Note** data inside `index.md` of _finalist_ should be same as before if you have to make changes do inside `participant` index.md file first.
- Once your **PR** gets accepted that should reflect [here](https://2020.teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev/finalist/) like:
