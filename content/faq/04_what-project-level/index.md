Build an industry level project. Intermediate to advance level. You don’t want to build a calculator or a tic-tac-toe game. Our hiring partners expect some good projects so that it's easier for them to judge our participants’ skillset better.

Can you build something like

- facebook, i.e. a _social media tool_
- slack, i.e. a _realtime communication tool_
- flipkart, i.e. an _e-commerce tool_
- evernote, i.e. a _powerful note taking tool_
- blogger? i.e. a _content management system_

Take anything big and build your version. Build a Tinder for books, and name it _Binder_ :P. Build Facebook for non profits and volunteers. Build instagram for quotes _only_. Or build any intermediate or advance level project that your course teaches you.
