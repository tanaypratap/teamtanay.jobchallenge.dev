Yes, you need to register to participate. I'm creating a repo where you just need to send a PR saying you're participating and that's all. We'll help you complete the challenge.
However, you don't need to wait to get started. Initialize your Github repository and start working. Only thing which you need to make sure is that the repo is initialized on or after 8th March, 2020 only.
We'll share the details of registration soon. Join the telegram group https://t.me/teamtanay (or search for #teamtanay in telegram) for future updates.

1. [Git/GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUxy4WNdc0s&t=3244s)
1. [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

Basic proficiency in these is needed. Formal registrations will start this weekend i.e. 15th March mostly. Before that, it's good to know these two things.
