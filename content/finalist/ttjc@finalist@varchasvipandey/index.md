### blogs

#### 1. Asynchronous array behaviour in JavaScript

While working with any API, you might have come across a situation where your response returns some data that’s when pushed into an array returns a weird thing! This looks like an array and you might also see your data there, but have you ever tried checking it’s “length” or maybe applying some cool array functions like “map”?

#### 2. Quick MERN application & a way to Cross the CORS

You might be familiar with the term CORS. If not then I guess you haven’t worked much with APIs and requests. Let’s start with a formal introduction of CORS (from Wikipedia): Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

#### 3. Next.JS Revolution! MERN Stack Boon!

If you have a good React development experience then congratulations! You already know how to use Next.JS. But the main purpose of Next.JS was not to replace React.JS from the front-end. Next.JS became popular because of its one of the important characteristics i.e. Pre-Rendering. That means, it can create a server-rendered React application very easily. This blog is going to be interesting because I’m going to show you how to get started with a full-stack MERN application using Next.JS. I’ll also do a head to head comparison between simple React.JS with Express.JS setup and Next.JS with Express.JS setup.
