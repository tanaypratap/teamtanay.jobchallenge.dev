Hi! I am Digvijay, MERN stack developer. üëãüë®‚Äçüíª

### introduction

üëãüë®‚Äçüíª Hi! I am Digvijay, a 15 y/o MERN developer from Jodhpur, Rajasthan. All I have learnt till now is self taught. I love building tech-based products, I have worked at a startup previously as an intern. I enjoy learning new technologies and startup.

## why are you taking this challenge? ü§∑

I need an internship/job to have some experience of writing code for a porduction level application that helps a large number of users, which will ultimately let me learn and explore more.

## something interesting about you? ü§©

As a 15 year old I always think my next project will be a billion dollar startup.
