Hello! 👋 I'm Abhishek, a wannabe web and/or mobile developer. Well, I can develop things, let's add great to that. A great web and/or mobile developer,
I want to be a great web and/or mobile developer❗️ It's web and/or mobile because I want to explore both.

## Introduction

I'm a final year, computer science student, from JC Bose UST, Faridabad, Haryana. TeamTanay introduced me to building things, JobChallenge provided the needed motivation. Now, I can develop applications for the web using `JavaScript`, with `ReactJS`, `ExpressJS`, `NodeJS`, databases like `MongoDB` and `MySQL`, and query languages like `SQL`, `GraphQL`. I plan on learning React Native, while simultaneously brushing up on my web skills.

### Why are you taking this challenge?

I want a job/internship, where I can work on developing products for mass users, and learn best coding practices from the people in the industry. Learn the product life cycle. Learn about testing and making better performing products.

### Something interesting about you? 🏸 💪 🎶

I am a pro badminton player who enjoys conditioning workouts the same as playing. ❤️sports ❤️music, so much love but still single 😕

### Help I need? 🔍

I need a driving force and a commmunity which helps and motivates me to develop things.

## My Projects

### Teacher's Diary 📖

_description_ My first full stack project on MERN stack, It is an implementation to teacher's diary, it's capable of keeping track of classes taught, students in them, and their marks and attendance for teachers. Teachers can add classes, add students, mark their attendance, add marks for exams, and edit and delete all these. This idea was given by my professor+mentor at college.
