I have created and used Django APIs for Like and Blog Subscription functions. I have also created a CI/CD pipeline using Github action workflow to deploy project at AWS S3.

### **2. TTJC Review app: Made with React Native for Mentors**

Created an app in React native for the mentors of 2020.teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev.
This app uses Github graphql API's to fetch ISSUES from teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev repository and use some regex magic to render all the projects which are submitted for review.

App has following features:

- Shows how many total projects are submitted for review in details
- Shows how many projects are reviewed.
- Shows how many projects are yet to review.
- Shows how many students have applied for review via issues.
- Shows total projects in review with respect to each student.

Note: Only those issues are considered which passes the regex match i.e. those issue titles that have [Project] or related syntax in it

### blogs

#### Django and ReactJS – A Match Made in Heaven

Django and React is an excellent combination. With React's SPA and Django's long list of essential libraries, we can create outstanding website apps. For this application to work, React will have to interact with Django, i.e., retrieving and storing data. To create the interface with integration, we will create API in the Back-end(Django) and consume that API in Front-end(React).

#### Why my blog is not on Medium

The short answer is I want to be the sole owner of the content I write, and Medium just don't allow it.

Medium is a platform that doesn't get you reputation and views - quality and uniqueness of your content does, regardless of what platform it's on. So you'd better use your own. **[Read more](https://blog.viralsangani.me/posts/why-my-blog-is-not-on-medium/)**

#### VIM is tough, or is it??? [Part 1]

In the past, I am stuck with this idea of making more with less, in the context of refactoring the line of code in the most efficient way possible. Recently I am exploring the use of VIM to unleash unlimited power of a text editor. VIM enables me to achieve more with every keystroke and with every hour I invest in programming. **[Read more](https://blog.viralsangani.me/posts/vim-is-tough-or-is-it/)**
