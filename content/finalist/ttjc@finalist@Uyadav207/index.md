#### **Random Color Generator App -- React Native 📱**

Expo is a framework for React-Applications. Developer can easily built both Ios and Android platform mobile application. we can easily develop, build , deploy the app quickly. And the best part about react-native is that it gives a Native look to our Mobile / Web Application from the same JavaScript and TypeScript codebase.

I have tried showing the perfect use of UseState Hooks in here.
