## Why?

Simple, to create visibility. You get job offers when you have a good portfolio with projects and everything; and recruiters notice you.
You create the _portfolio_, I will take care of the _noticing_ part. We already have hiring partners signed up who'll be interviewing the winners. Is there a better way to get placed than this?
