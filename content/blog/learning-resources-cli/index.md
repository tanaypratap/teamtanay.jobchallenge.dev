CLI apps or so called __command line apps__ are a fantastic way to learn language features and also to do some cool stuffs.

## Learning Resources to build them from scratch

* [JavaScript (Node)](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/command-line/how-to-parse-command-line-arguments/)
* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/argparse.html)
* [Go](https://blog.rapid7.com/2016/08/04/build-a-simple-cli-tool-with-golang/)
* [C/C++](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2013/01/c-argc-argv/)
* [Ruby](https://medium.com/rubycademy/program-arguments-in-ruby-ii-optionparser-ae24482568b9)

## Popular packages

Even though it is totally possible to build any CLI app with your bare hands(which we highly reccomend during initial learning phase) you can use some of the below packages to make your life little more easier

* [yargs - JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs)
* [meow - JavaScript](https://github.com/sindresorhus/meow)
* [cli - Go](https://github.com/urfave/cli)
* [click - Python](https://github.com/pallets/click)
* [TTY - Ruby](https://ttytoolkit.org/)
* [cli UI - Ruby](https://github.com/Shopify/cli-ui)

## Example projects

* https://github.com/sindresorhus/slugify-cli - JavaScript
* https://github.com/sindresorhus/delay-cli/blob/master/cli.js - JavaScript
* https://github.com/cdeil/python-cli-examples - Python

Similar approach can be taken for any language
