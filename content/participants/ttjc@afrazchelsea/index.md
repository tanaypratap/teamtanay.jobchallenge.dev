Hi! I am Afraz Momin. Let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I'm a final year engineering student based in Pune. I'm a Web Developer but I also have keen interest in the domain of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Having a good hold on my Data Structures and Algorithms, I like to spend my time solving problems on platforms like Codechef and Leetcode. I have also worked on iOS and Android platforms in the past.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I'll be completing my engineering degree by May 2020.
I need a job by June 2020.
I want to learn new technologies, make a good network and grow in this field.

## something interesting about you?

I like to play football and gymming is my favourite pastime. I also fancy cooking at times.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone guides me when I get stuck. A little push and I'll be on my way ahead.
