Hello World! I am Raghav Mangal, currently in my pre-final year of B.tech. grabbing opportunities to learn and contribute. let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a tech-enthusiast pursuing Bachelors of Technology. I feel lucky to be a part of this great tech community and want to contribute as much as i can to make this world a better place to live in through the power of 1's and 0's.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship so that i can learn, build and contribute.

## something interesting about you?

I am an avid-reader who wants to increase his horizon of knowledge every single day. I love dim lights and pop music while coding which i think is cool. I can play chess too. 

### help I need?

It would be good if someone guides or mentors me to find a way out in this sea of technologies so that i can resonate with my interests.
