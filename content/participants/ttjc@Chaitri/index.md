Hey, I'm Chaitri! 

### introduction

I'm presently working as a Sterling engineer supporting the E2E order management for an e-commerce firm, responsible for handling both B2B and B2C operations.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I'm looking for a role change, and web development is something that I have always wanted to get into. By participating in this challenge, I aspire to create multiple projects and flesh out my web dev expertise along the way.
## something interesting about you?

I'm a bibliophile at heart. Although I explore different genres of books, I find myself gravitating towards sci-fi, mystery, humour, and fantasy. I'm currently reading through Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, and cannot recommend it enough.

### help I need?

As I'm relatively new to professional web dev, I would appreciate any pointers for writing clean code, and on structuring my projects better.
