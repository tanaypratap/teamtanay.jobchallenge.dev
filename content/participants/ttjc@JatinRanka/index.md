Hi! I am a Jatin Ranka let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am currently pursuing B.E. in Computer Science from MNM Jain Engineering College.
Apart from tech, I am also interested in Marketing.

## why are you taking this challenge?

The major reason for me taking up this challenge is to get an internship. 
And not just that, I also want to be committed to something productive rather than wasting time on unwanted things. This challenge will boost me to have a better portfolio within a deadline.

## something interesting about you?

Though I am a tech guy, I am interested in marketing because it helps me to connect with people having different perspectives.

### help I need?

Being from a Tier - 3 college, I never got the guidance for getting an internship or a job in a good company. I need help from this challenge to cover those gaps to get an internship in a tech role.
