Hi, I'm Atul Bhatt. It's time I introduce myself to you. So let's get started.

### introduction

I am a college student who is currently trying to get the best out of this quarantine period. I'm pursuing MCA from Graphic Era University, Dehradun. I was always fond of computers and curious to learn about them, and then I discovered programming. Currently I'm in love with Python and trying to explore its power. I have tried making some web app using flask, python and Sqllite.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship in December 2020.
I want to learn. #teamtanayjobchallenge seems the perfect opportunity to push my limits of learning.

## something interesting about you?

I'm a writer. I write quotes, short stories, poetries. I also make the video of my Poetries and upload them to my YouTube Channel.

### help I need?

At the moment, I'm learning React and other related stuffs. I just need help in getting the right direction. Will update this as soon as I start kicking into a project.
