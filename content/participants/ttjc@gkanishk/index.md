### My Journey to TTJC

Job challenge has been a boon for me as I got an opportunity to become the moderator of this Job challenge. Before JC I was afraid to even push code but now I can blindly do that I am loving it. I reviewed multiple pull requests and that helped me a lot to skill up and learn team management. I have built new connections and been volunteering this community which is itself a win-win. All thanks to Tanay for giving me this opportunity.
I contributed to Open-source organizations like `Microsoft` and `Facebook` along with this job challenge which itself is a badge for me.
