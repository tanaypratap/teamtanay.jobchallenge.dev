Hi! I am Kumar Saurah Raj, Microsoft Student Partner at Bhagalpur College Of Engineering, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a sophomore student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Bhagalpur College of Engineering (BCE). I am javascript developer with experience in developing and deploying web applications based on the MERN stack public cloud platforms like GCP.
I love to contribute to open source and empower others. I am a part of several on campus technical societies and clubs and I have been fortunate to a part of Microsoft Student Partner Program.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I want an internship starting anywhere between June to December 2020 and I hope to learn and grow as a developer. I think there is a lot of potential to grow through programmes like these by reviewing code of other participant's projects.

## something interesting about you?

I love to watch movies and I would be surprised if you could name a good movie which I have not seen already :-)

### help I need?

I am not much familiar with React Hooks and advanced NodeJs concepts and I only have a basic(CRUD) understanding of mongoDB.
