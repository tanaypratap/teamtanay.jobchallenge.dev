My projects:

#### Rentspace : E-commerce app

_description_ Nomads now with the click of a button can easily buy their startup-spaces around the world. Although it's a small application, but taught me a lot of things as it's my first hands-on full stack project.

_stack_ Front-end made with React, 8base is used for backend-as-a-service with GraphQl powered querying.
