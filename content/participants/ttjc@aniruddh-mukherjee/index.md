Hello, I am Aniruddh. Aniruddh Mukherjee. I am fluent in React and I am currrently learning  React Native. 

### introduction

I am a high school student from Kolkata, currently in 12th. Computers have fascinated me ever since I got my first computer back in 2009. I started coding by learning C++, SQL etc. as part of the school curriculum, and then, for the past one year, JavaScript and all related tech have hooked me like nothing else! I have also done some freelancing as a Graphic Designer. I have experience withh Figma too. I am a proud member of #AvalonArmy!

## why are you taking this challenge?

I want to learn. I want to learn more, and if I get paid a bit at the same time, it would be great. Job or internship - any one of them would work.  

## something interesting about you?

My mind is always full of weird startup ideas. I listen to country music from the 60s. I love playing horror games at 3 AM. 

### help I need?

It would be really great if anyone could tell me how to handle serverless payments using Firebase.

### projects

Have done one project so far. Will keep updating this space!

My projects:

#### GameStory: All you need to know about a game!

_description_ Gamers often struggle to grasp the complex stories behind the story-based games available on different platforms. This web app intends to find a solution for that. All the data are user generated, available for everyone.

_stack_ Made in React with hooks and context. This is written in javascript. Backend is powered by Firebase Realtime Database and Authentication.
