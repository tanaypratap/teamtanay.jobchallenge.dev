Hi Everyone! I am Harshitha. 
Want to know more about me ? Then keep reading.

### introduction

I am a software developer with 3+ years of experience in total of which 2 years into front-end development. I was working for a reputed company in Bangalore (India). I moved to Amsterdam (Netherlands) with my husband recently. 


## why are you taking this challenge?

When I relocated here, I thought of taking a break, explore Europe and then start the job hunt. Keeping the current situation in mind, I don't think, I can roam everywhere now. (Corona Effect). Moreover, Front-end developers are high in demand everywhere. Apart from projects that we worked for the company, lot of employers look for candidates with pet projects. With no job in hand and sitting all day at home, I feel this challenge will be helpful in shaping my career and spending my time wisely. I am open to take up remote jobs opportunities through this challenge as well. 

## something interesting about you?

When I don't code, I love exploring new places, cooking and gardening.

### help I need?

Hands-on with any front-end framework (React)
