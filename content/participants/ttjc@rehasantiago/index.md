#### Come fix me (Also won the most innovative solution in bitcamp 2019)

_description_ A system for citizens to register pothole issues. User clicks a photo of the pothole and registers an issue in the app.The photo is then uploaded to the firebase database along with other information like GPS coordinates etc.A script checks if pothole is present. If a pothole is detected, he estimated area is calculated, else the user's issue is rejected.
After successful detection, details are sent to government officials. Once the officials claim that they have fixed the pothole, the user gets a notification and they can close their issue.

#### why I liked GraphQL over REST?

_description_ GraphQL solves both over-fetching and under-fetching issues by allowing the client to request only the needed data. Because of this graphql is much faster.
