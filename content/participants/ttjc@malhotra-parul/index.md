Hi! I am Parul located in Gurgaon. Let me walk you through my journey so far for you to get to know me better!

### introduction

I have 5 years of work experience as a Senior QA engineer. Have worked with MNCs like Tata Consultancy Services and Makemytrip.com. I decided to transition to MERN stack a few months back and have been reading and building projects since then.

## why are you taking this challenge?

 I am interested in building full stack apps to build a solid portfolio in order to learn Javascript frameworks inside out and get a job suiting my expertise. This challenge fits my goals perfectly. I have been writing blogs anyway and building projects. This challenege has added a deadline, provided me a community and helped me with ideas to build better and more interesting things.

## something interesting about you?

I love coding and fashion blogging - two extremely different paths.

### help I need?

Help me by sharing with me, ideas, so that I can build interesting projects and write better blogs on topics which are not so common to find.
