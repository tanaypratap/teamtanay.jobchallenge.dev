Namaste Everyone! I am Megha Pathak, a curiosity-driven, Product-minded developer passionate about envisioning and developing great products and learns what is required on the go.

### introduction

I have experience developing and designing software for the web, from simple landing pages to web applications. I strive to create software that not only functions efficiently under the hood but also provides intuitive, pixel-perfect user experiences. I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences for efficient, and scalable products. At the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful for people that bring out the best in me.


## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship/job in July 2020.
I am an active Open source contributor and expanding my learning manifolds with Open Source development and communities. 

## something interesting about you?

I have build my career by leveraging communities at every turn. So, when I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably speaking to my communities, by organizing workshops and meetups, or taking webinars to help them as well as myself. Along with this, I keep myself engaged with various side-projects that push me to use my creative and diverse competence. I always am open to experiment and explore any novel thing that piques my interest. 

Also, I love painting, petting dogs, and reading.

### help I need?

This challenge helped me a lot in gearing up my game with front-end development. Now I am looking forward to explore backend more to the breadth of my skillset.
