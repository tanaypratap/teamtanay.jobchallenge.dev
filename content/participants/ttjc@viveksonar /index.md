### Projects

Project 1: **Dice Game** URL: https://dice100.netlify.com/

 Github repo: https://github.com/viveksonar/PigGame

It’s an interactive game that runs on one browser window. Two players can play at one time. When you click the roll dice button, you'll roll a random dice number, and you can roll it as many times you want. Still, if the dice rolls to 1 your score resets to zero and next player gets the chance to toll the dice you can hold your score when you want but after holding you lose your chance to roll the dice and you would have to wait for the next player to go 1 or hold his score and the first player to get 100 score wins.

Technology used: HTML5.0, CSS3.0, and Javascript.

Project 2: **Sentiment Analysis**

Github Repo:https://github.com/viveksonar/sentimentanalyzer

Its a microservice based webapp which has three micro services i used Html,Css for frontend ,Spring as a backend, and Python for logic of the analyzer then i wrote docker files to containerize this microservices and also deployed them on kubernetes cluster.Yaml files for kubernetes deployment are on my github repo.
This apps shows the sentiment of the sentence you write in the text-segment and to analize this it uses Python.
