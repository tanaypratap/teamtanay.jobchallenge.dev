Hi! This is Shivam Verma, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a Panda trapped inside a Human Body, I love to code and to make things using my skills.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship.
I love to code but I am kind of lazy so this challenge will always push me to work harder and become a better developer,
Also the support of mentors,fellow challengers and community which this challenge is providing is incomparable.

## something interesting about you?

I fell in love with JavaScript the first time I used it, I love reading books, writing poems, I love teaching and I have been teaching students as a part-time job since the past 3.5 years, I am a foodie,  I love spending time with dogs.

### help I need?

I am still in the learning phase and also a noob developer, so it will always be a blessing to have a guidance from senior developer as an elder brother/sister.
