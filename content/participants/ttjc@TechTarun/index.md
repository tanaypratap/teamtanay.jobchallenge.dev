Hello! I am Tarun Agarwal, BTech(CSE) 3rd year student. Python is my fav; coding is my hobby. So let me take you through some of my creations and contributions... 

### introduction

I am BTech(CSE) 3rd year student. I am a bookworm and so I learn from books. My hobby is coding and I enjoy reading about newer technologies and implementing them(if possible). Python is my favourite language but I also know C/C++ and currently Go is going on. My favourite subject is DS & Algo and I am highly impacted by CLRS.
My motivation is Elon Musk as I too believe in developing my own solutions rather that asking others to solve my problems. I don't want to learn alone and so I always try to teach what all I know to my juniors and fellows in seminars in my college. 
Harry Potter is my favourite fiction series and in that Professor Dumbledore is the one whom I admire the most. I also love watching and seeing about space and have seen series on space and universe like Cosmos, Into the space.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship for my summer vacations before my final year.
I want to learn and I have read somewhere that the best way of learning is by doing.

## something interesting about you?

You can talk and discuss with me about "Harry Potter" and about "Space and Universe" and I wont get tired rather I will enjoy it. That's my favourite topics.

### help I need?

I seek some help to learn more about ML and DL.

### projects

Most of the projects are from 2019. Developing one currently. Let's see them all..

My projects:

#### Awaaz : voice-based grievance redressal system

_description_ It is a voice assistant that is designed to make complaints getting heard. In any organization using Awaaz, a user/customer can simply speak his/her complaint/grievance and that gets sorted/categorized through a ML model. A log is also being generated for each complaint so that user can follow up.

_stack_ Prototype is developed in Kivy. Python NLP module pyttsx3 with SAPI5 voice engine is used to handle voice input. The categorization and sorting process is being done using NLTK module.

#### Intelligent Project Master(IPM) : Jarvis for corporations

_description_ A voice assistant easing the work of the developers in the IT industry. A smart voice assistant that takes user voice command and extract-mine-analyze-present the optimal response. IPM provides user platform to perform many tasks on Github, Jira, Confluence and Bitbucket through voice commands such as creating Jira ticket, raising github issue etc.  

_stack_ The prototype is in development phase with a 
        - web app in HTML, CSS and Django as backend; SQLite is used as database
        - mobile application in Flutter; Google Firestore is used as database
        Input and output is being handled by pyttsx3 module.
        String processing algorithms like tf-idf are performing the task of creating a optimal response. RAKE Algorithm is used as ML contribution to IPM.

#### Social Searcher

_description_ Many a times, there is a need to search for a person's public profile that has become uncontactable on available contact details and address. The social searcher is for the above purpose.

_stack_ Having a HTML, CSS and JS based web platform, the social searcher is powered by AWS Boto3 and Lambda function and leverage seachr API's of social media platforms like facebook, twitter and linkedin.
