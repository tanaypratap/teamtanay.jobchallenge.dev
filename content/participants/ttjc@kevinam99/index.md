### projects

A couple of cool projects I made or been a part of. I will keep updating it with real links when done.

My projects:

#### Nodejs - Tally Integration

_description_ Wrote a bunch of modules in Node.js to extract data from Tally.ERP9 seamlessly and automatically. I later did an internship which was a continuation of this app adding more features. The complete app is a private repo on GitHub.

_stack_ Made in pure Node.js. My role in this project was majorly as backend developer.

#### Instagram Like Bot
_description_ This app helps to automatically log into an Instagram account with hashtags as input. Th bot then looks for those images pertaining to the provided hashtags and automatically likes the pictures. Helps to gain traction for your own profile. I made the simple GUI using PyQT

_stack_ Made in Python.

#### Ultrasonic distance sensor

_description_ This project is an application of SONAR. The ultrasonic ranging module will emit and receive ultrasonic waves. The distance will be the time take to receive the waves back by the receiver. The formula is

                            distance=speed/time

Ultrasonic waves travel at the speed of light. So plug in the speed of light and the time taken to receive the waves into the equation and you'll get the distance.

_stack_ Made in Arduino (embedded C) and Processing to compensate for a display. Used an ultrasonic ranging module.

### blogs

same as projects, I will keep updating my blogs as and when done.

#### Mouse control with hand gestures

_description_ Here I have written step by step on how to implement and the working of my project.
