_description_ : Do you travel often? Are there times when you want to go to some place for the weekend but you cannot find the place to go? This website will help you. Get ideas for places to go along with your friends for a small adventure.

_stack_ Frontend is just plain HTML/CSS along with some Bootstrap. Backend is powered by Node.js and database used is MongoDB. So to simplify, the stack is MEN.
