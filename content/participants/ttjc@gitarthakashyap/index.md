Hi! I am a student let me walk you through my intro, blogs and projects.

### introduction

I am a 1st year cse enginnering undergrad my end goal is to be a MERN full stack web/app develeoper. Still a newbie to lot of things, but everyone was a newbie at some point of time.
You won't be disappointed

## why are you taking this challenge?

I want to learn and enhance my skills and getting an Internship at such an early stage will
help me a lot.For internships I will be availabe in July/December 2020 (summer/winter vac)
If it's an offline Internship, you don't need to pay me anything, I can sleep in your office by the night and work there by the day. Just provide enough money to eat and travel (when necessary )

## something interesting about you?

I am interested in filmmkaing. I like poetry, specially urdu. When your job revolves around 
writing language for the machine, algorithms and logics, poetries are a nice escape.  

### help I need?

As I have mentioned above that I am learning react, after completing it and doing some clone projects with the hel from youtube. I want to build an pwa for my university(have some ideas in my mind don't to share it here)It would be good if I find someone to talk to about this idea and their guidance will help me a lot.
