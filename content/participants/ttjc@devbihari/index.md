### blogs

#### Why learn Docker

_description_  Software development is hard. Especially when you are working on a product with separate components that are required to be integrated together. Over the years different software development techniques have been developed to streamline the development process and meet the requirements and quality at the same time. However, in recent years as cloud-based technologies have flourished, most of the existing development methods have become somewhat difficult to manage when it comes to developing quick and fast cloud-based software solutions. In this blog post I discussed why to learn docker and the technologies and processes that surround it.

#### The future of App development

_description_ In the last few years, native app development has seen a shift from the 'native' tech stack to a more 'web' oriented development stack. While one can easily read articles and find loads of reason for this I think one the fundamental level there is only 1 reason for this shift: the need for One-to-many application. In this post, I dived into this reason to understand what it is.

#### Why learn Redux in 2020: A way to deal with react's messy state management 

_description_ Let's be honest, react's state management is a nightmare for everyone working on large and small projects alike. The tree like structure that react brings to the table is sure worth it but the state management causes more pain than pleasure. In this blog post I talked about redux and why everyone should be using it.

#### Why I Prefer PyTorch Over TensorFlow: Same Reason I Prefer Linux Over Windows 

_description_ As a deep learning practitioner I like (or require) custom architectures for my projects or research papers which can be difficult to build using TensorFlow because itâ€™s implementation is not very friendly (non-pythonic). Hence, building a custom architecture in TensorFlow is time-consuming. In this blog post I spoke about how beautiful PyTorch is.

#### --save and --save-dev : Why You Should know The Difference

_description_ As a newbie, we all make mistakes and overlook things because either they look simple or overly complex. While this ignorance does not cause any major embarrassment in our devlife (hopefully), sometimes somethings are worth paying attention to. In this blog post I wrote about one of these little things we ignore --save and --save-dev
