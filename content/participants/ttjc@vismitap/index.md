Hi! I am an undergraduate computer science student who will be graduating next year. 
### introduction

I am always curious to learn and with proper deadline,motivation and guidance, I believe there is nothing that I can't do.


## why are you taking this challenge?

I think this challenge is an awesome opportunity for me to win an interview with the tech giants which otherwise is very difficult to get. We are getting this opportunity because of you Tanay sir and I hope we all enjoy this learning process and make You proud!

## something interesting about you?
I like sketching and recently came across something called the 'Codeart'. Would love to explore that too. 
I like participating in various competitions and hackathons. I have participated  in competitions like AAVISHKAR, KPIT, IICDC, ETCS, eYANTRA ROBOTICS COMPETITION 2017-18
and 2019-20, Facebook presents Hertech hackathon (one of the top 9 teams out of 80), Smart India Hackathon(SIH) 2018-19 and 2019-20.

After participating in  eYANTRA and SIH for the second time, this year we got selected and are representing our college in both the competitions. 

### help I need?


Reviews on my code and some ideas to make my code more readable and optimised is all I want to learn.
Always wanted to learn Web development using react. I feel this challenge would prove to be a great start to my React journey.
