Hey let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a budding developer currently undergoing BTech CS at College of Engineering Chengannur. I am good at Python and Machine Learning, currently learning Flask.

## why are you taking this challenge?

The one of the main reasons is that this challenge gives me an opportunity to learn new technologies and also to network and interact with awesome mentors and ultimately learn to build better products. There’s also the added perk of a job interview
