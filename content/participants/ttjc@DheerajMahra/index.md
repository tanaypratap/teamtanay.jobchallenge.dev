Hey there! I am Dheeraj Mahra, a 22 years old young lad. Below, you will find more about me and details of my submissions to this #TTJC.

### introduction

I have a strong inclination towards Web Programming. My tech stack includes React, Redux, Javascript, Sass, PHP, MySQL. Currently, I'm working on React-Redux projects and learning NodeJS to kick PHP out of my sight.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I'm taking this challenge to get a startup that matches my skillset so that I can showcase myself. I have offers from Infosys and Wipro. Joining them is a nightmare for me as they will be killing all my creativity and I will eventually loose my grasp on my core web domain. 

## something interesting about you?

I can make you fall for me with my piano skills. ;) 

### help I need?

I want help in authentication and Real-Time Communication.
