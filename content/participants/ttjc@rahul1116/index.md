Hi! I am Rahul Ravindran let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am code freak and I love to know how real world applications are made. I'm always curious about experiencing the journey of learning something new.

I have realized the only way someone is going to learn to code faster, is by actually making projects and implementing all the newly learned concepts.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need a job so that I can improve my skillset. I'd love to learn from my colleagues who are in the industry for several years. I want to learn latest technologies in the market and expand my knowledge base.

## something interesting about you?

I love Counter-Strike game because then, I can say I'm from CS background!

### help I need?

I would like to be mentored about **GraphQL** as it is one of the latest technology that I picked up.
I would also like to know about how to integrate Google, Facebook, etc auth to your website.
