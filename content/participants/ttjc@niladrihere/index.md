Hi! I am  Niladri. I am a Python developer with analytic skills. Let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

A guy with skills and able to work under pressure. Hard worker, I would rather not count myself as one therefor I look for the optimal way to complete a project as soon as possible. Took this challenge to enhance my skills over other domains.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need job.

## something interesting about you?

I can tear down each and every computer, mend it and assemble it perfectly in one piece. I reapplied thermal paste on 5 laptops. I successfully booted up mac os catalina on my acer nitro 5 .

### help I need?

As I have knowledge of programming language I think it wouldn't be such a problem for me, anyways Stackoverflow team has their hands over us.
