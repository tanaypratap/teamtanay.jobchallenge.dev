Namaste, I am Harshith Venkatesh , let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am currently working in CenturyLink as a Software Engineer, I have got the opportunity to develop enterprise dashboard, data visualization utility tool and enhancements such as form upload to document display and other features. I have developed the front end deck using Angular 7.

I have pursued B.Tech - Electronics and Communication branch in Manipal Institute of Technology and transitioned from Telecommunication Domain to Information Technology Domain in the span of One and Half year and I really enjoy exploring different opportunities that IT provides.

## why are you taking this challenge?

Honestly, I really liked the challenge and this will definitely motivate me to explore different frameworks, libraries of JS. I really want to realize how much I can toil along with the 10 hour daily work schedule, and to utilize my time in building my portfolio.

I would really want to be part of the Open Source community. I believe joining this community will provide me enough opportunity to discuss and join/form a team to work on the same.

I believe working on typescript for 1.5 years has built enough confidence in me to create a project in Angular Framework from Scratch. I would like to build my portfolio in a way to attract companies to look into my portfolio and thus leading to Switching for better opportunities.

🏃Update 06/29/2020
In a month, I have gained a lot of knowledge by being a part of this community and the opportunity I have got to meet talented front end devs, and their ideas were mesmerizing. I even got the opportunity to help a few college grads with the Gyan that I have got on placements and in my journey.

Whether this helps me in job opportunities here or not, but I have indeed got a confidence boost to prepare JS in-depth and has given me the clarity to feel confident enough to give Front End Developer Interview in much more confidently.
I do have a great path ahead and joining this challenge, It has eased my complex path ahead with a lot of tips, ideas, reviews, etc.,

## something interesting about you?

I am ambidextrous.
I can crack jokes in 6 different languages 🙃
I prefer spending my holidays/weekends by helping students in mathematics(My faourite subject). I got the opportunity to visit few schools to share my experiance and knowledge to pursue on different career options.
I like gardening and cooking.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone helps and suggest me the best practices while working on projects.
Maybe just pointing me out that a particular link in youtube would help me more on particular tech stack would definitely make some one's day better :)
Tanay , you have helped me a lot in this, While I will definitely would follow your suggestions but I am open for more.
