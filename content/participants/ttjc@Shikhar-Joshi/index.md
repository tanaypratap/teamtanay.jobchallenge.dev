Hi! I am Shikhar Joshi pursuing Engineering in Computer Science. 

### introduction

My name is Shikhar. I'm conscious about my fitness and I've 3+ year experience in Calisthenics(body weight training). Till now I've worked in Django and developed a project. I've also participated in Crido.Do competition and there I get Relentless Bee badge.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I've lived in an environment where I just learn and never applied it to something bigger. It's not that I don't want to work the thing is I never get a big opportunity. But this challenge is huge. Taking this challenge help me to push my limit to an extent where I can create something amazing.

## something interesting about you?

I have learned Hanuman Chalisa in a single night. 

### help I need?

If someone ask a question and I gave the answer then I want mentors to give some extra points about the issue(if possible) even if the answer is completely correct. In this way I can learn different approach to solve the problem. Apart from that if I need help in React and React native.
