### projects

•Waste management using Arduino.
	We developed a standalone prototype system using nodemcu and few sensors to sense if the dustbin was filled.
	The whole system was connected the cloud and through the app the user gets an alert when the dustbin is about to fill up.
	The system also had a motor and belt setup when the secondary dustbin would move and replace the main one after filling.
•Designed and developed Cockpit for college formula Bharath team car.
	Designed and developed different parts like instrument cluster, ignition system and few other systems for the cockpit of 
	the formula Bharath car according to their standards.
•Machinery Power monitoring and control system using SCADA.
	Developed and electronic system that records consumption of electric energy in intervals by a machinery used in industrial 
	application and communicates the information over HMI.It is a SCADA based system which constantly monitors power consumed by 
	machinery and alarms the operator in case of abnormal power consumption. 
•Integrated security in Steering wheel using R-pi and Arduino.
	Developed a standalone prototype module for increasing the security of the car and to avoid car accidents due to drunk driver. 
	The modules consisted of DMS along with a breath analyzer which would test the authenticity of the driver using machine learning 
	and do breath alcohol to avoid drunk driving.
