Hello! I'm Suryansh I am a full stack developer. Let me walk you through my journey so far.

### introduction

I am an engineering undergrad at IET DAVV, Indore. I have worked to develop projects in the MEAN stack and wrote python scripts for my three years at this institute. I am proficient at coding and with multiple internship experiences I have industry exposure. I work as a full stack developer and also a graphic designer.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I am looking for a job right after college in an open environment. This challenge is enticing to me because it provides the much needed push to develop a portfolio and offers the kind of job I'm looking for.

## something interesting about you?

I am a bookworm. I used to read multiple books in a day. I have limited it to one book per week to focus on other things.
