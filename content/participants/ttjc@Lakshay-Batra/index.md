### blogs

same as projects, I will keep updating my blogs as and when done.

#### HTML file paths.

_description_ Few days back one guy in the telegram group(team tanay) was facing difficulty in referring to the image in a folder one level up from the current folder containing style.css where he was trying to set that image as background of website as he was not giving right file path.
Though it is a simple topic but yet many of the new developers face issue with this which insisted me to write this blog.

#### Fork a repo - GitHub.

_description_ Forking is the main concept which everyone should know who is diving into open source.
So I thought of writing a blog over it, and explain the process with examples.

#### Color theory & Typography.

_description_ For a UI UX designer it is important to understand color theory and typography.
It is Color theory & Typography which can let you present your thoughts in an exact manner thus I thought of writing a blog over it and clearing all the concepts behind colors & typography.
