Hey!! I'm Bhavika Kulkarni

### introduction

I am a third year undergrad CSE student from MIT, Pune.  I started learning website designing as a hobby and as I progressed I found myself highly fond of making this look visually appealing, hence I decided to give web development a try and here I am, on an endless journey of learning new and exciting technologies everyday. 

## why are you taking this challenge?

I'm looking for an internship and this challenge is the perfect opportunity for me as a developer to grow and hone my front-end development skills.
## something interesting about you?

Apart from an web designing, I like to paint.

### help I need?

I would very much appreciate help around JavaScript and React.
