Hi! I am Shivam Bhatia, B.Tech CSE third year student at SRMIST, Delhi-NCR. Let me walk you through my introduction, projects and blogs.


### introduction

I am Full Stack/MERN stack developer. I love to design my ideas into code. Still learning new technologies.

## why are you taking this challenge?

Looking for an organization where I can use the skills I have learnt by devloping my personal projects.
Want to learn more by working on big projects and want to learn from mentors.

## something interesting about you?

- I love to try something new and creative so that I can use that in my project.
- On my personal basis I like graphic designing and video editing.

### help I need?

I am still learning to develop more and more skills. But sometimes some things are very complex and difficult to understand and with small help I will break it down.

### projects
It is a simple Google Keep clone- https://notes-keeper-app-shivam.netlify.app
It is a simple weather website that updates background with city images- https://weather-app-shivam.netlify.app
It is a simple recipe app- https://recipe-app-shivam.netlify.app
These 3 projects are only based on react and are quite basic because I am new to React but I have many other projects based on HTML/CSS,Javascript,Jquery,MongoDB,SQL,Express,Node.js and EJS that you can see on my Github.

### blogs

Like projects, I will keep updating my blogs when I complete.
