Hi! I am Shivam Bhatia, B.Tech CSE third year student at SRMIST, Delhi-NCR. Let me walk you through my introduction, projects and blogs.


### introduction

I am Full Stack/MERN stack developer. I love to design my ideas into code. So I am still learning new technologies.

## why are you taking this challenge?

Looking for an organization where I can use the skills I have learnt by devloping my personal projects.
Want to learn more by working on big projects and want to learn from mentors.

## something interesting about you?

- I love to try something new and creative so that I can use that in my project.
- On personal basis I like graphic designing and video editing.

### help I need?

I am still learning to develop more and more skills. But sometimes some things are very complex and difficult to understand and with small help I will break it down.

### projects
It is a simple Google Keep clone, I made this app using Reactjs- https://notes-keeper-app-shivam.netlify.app <br />
It is a simple weather website that updates background with city images,I made this app using Reactjs and Unsplash API and Open weather API- https://weather-app-shivam.netlify.app <br />
It is a simple recipe appI made this app using Reactjs and Edaman API- https://recipe-app-shivam.netlify.app <br />
These 3 projects are based on React only and are quite basic because I am new to React but I have many other projects based on HTML/CSS,Javascript,Jquery,MongoDB,SQL,Express,Node.js and EJS that you can see on my Github.

### blogs

1) I made this list because it is kind of a struggle to take your project/website out of localhost and show it to the world. So here is a list of free tools to help you showcase your projects: https://medium.com/@shivambhatia_64475/top-5-services-for-developers-to-show-their-web-projects-for-free-b51b1ad0c9e9 <br />
2) From last three months, I am building a variety of full stack projects for my portfolio. During this journey I have found many intersting APIs that are really helpful for basic projects. Few of them are mentioned below : https://medium.com/@shivambhatia_64475/top-free-apis-for-web-development-beginners-e0cb23883ce <br />
3) I see many new developers fighting about what to specialize in Front End or Back End. Here is my journey of how I got to know which one is the best one.
