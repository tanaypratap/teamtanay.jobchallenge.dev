Hi! I am Mihir, a javascript developer.

### introduction

Hi! I am a Mhir Gupta, a 17y/o high school student from Jaipur, Rajasthan. I am currently learning the basics of javascript by making small web apps and learning the basics of react native.


## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship to have some experience of writing production level code and to work and learn from like minded people.

## something interesting about you?

I love space, physics and love to read lots of books.

It would be highly appreciated if I am provided with some help for learning to work full stack apps and potentially applying ML algorithms to web apps
