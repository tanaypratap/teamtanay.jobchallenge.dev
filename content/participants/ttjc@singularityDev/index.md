### projects

####My projects:

**Portfolio Website (New)**

_Description_ Everyone in the creative field must have a portfolio website to showcase their work and experience, I'm not a very experienced one but I do believe that it is necessary no matter the experience. I have played with the flex box and learned ways to make a website responsive within a limited time now.

_Stack_ I wanted to keep it simple, so, no framework. It is made responsive through hard code using Flex-Box.

 **Another Todo App (New)**

_Description_ My Internship was into AngularJs stack and I wanted to explore ReactJs of MERN stack, I thought to learn GraphQL, ApolloClient as well. Once I made the app with CRUD functionalities, also wanted to explore authentication side to implement my own authentication system and  I added authentiation to this website using JWT, I used two tokens, one for generating new tokens and remembering the user on the device, and other for sending requests from client, I've read some articles and watched some videos on better ways to authenticate a user and use tokens without compromising privacy and security. Now, this coud be my boilerplate code for any ReactJs website.  

_Stack_ MERN stack (ReactJs, GraphQL, Apollo client, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB), JsonWebToken,  plain HTML and CSS.
