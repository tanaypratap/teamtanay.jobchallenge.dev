Hi! This is Ayush Singh Kushwaha, a third year CSE student from SRM-IST,Chennai.I want to become a full stack web developer and I think I am on the right path by taking this challenge.

### introduction

I am in love with technology specially web development. I can spend hours on developing websites and reading articles related to this field. Apart from web development, AI also facinates me and would love to make an AI of my own just like Tony Stark ;) 

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need a job in June 2020 because I don't trust my college for my placement and also I don't want to work in a service based company working on something that I don't like.

## something interesting about you?

I love playing cricket whether its on computer or ground.
I like suspense and crime genre movies and shows.

### help I need?

It would be great if someone can guide me to learn react too and would need some advice for nodejs projects as I am new to nodejs.
