Hi! I am Shreesha Sagar from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore. Let me walk you through my Intro, Projects and Blogs.

### Introduction

Currently pursuing B.E, 6th semester in Information Science and Enginnering at RV College of Bangalore. I've worked as an intern for companies like OnePlus as a Student Partner and startups like Rovok as a Software Engineering Intern. This field of Development always keeps changing, you finish a project and there is already a new framework better than the one used, so I always strive to keep updated and analyze stuff. I am not just a fast learner but an effecient one. I learnt React, Angular and Vue in just a span of 2 months (during lockdown) and have done projects on all of them - just saying !

## Why are you taking this challenge?

The current times (COVID-19 Lockdown) are such that you have ample amount of time especially for a student to learn and create new things. So, why not benefit from it by learning and building stuff that not only increases one's skill but also helps you score a job! 

## Something interesting about you?

In the age of Rock, Pop, R&B I play Hindustani Classical Music with Flute, Tabla and Sitar.

### Help I need?

It would be good if someone guides me through the various JavaScript frameworks.
