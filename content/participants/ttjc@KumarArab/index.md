description: "A computer science student with average programming and problem solving skills."

I am a computer science student at Birla Institute of Technology.Few things about me:

### introduction

I am a T-shaped programmer(according to google).I love each and every technology except the hardwares.I consumed my two years of college by learning lots of different things but now I think I need to stick to a 
particular field to keep going and make money.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need the practical exposure.I want to know how things actually work  at industry level and internships are the best opportunities to showcase our skills along with learning new stuffs.

## something interesting about you?

Actually there is nothing interesting about me because instead of doing something I prefer sleeping.also I love rap music because they are difficult to memorize and I love difficult jobs.

### help I need?

I need a mentor who can guide me.This brain has too much potential but it dosen't know where to apply.I guess an experienced person can tell me better ways to use it.

_stack_ A simple web app made using html,css,express,ejs and few other npm packages.It is too backed with mongodb.it allows users to make multiple lists just be changing the list name in url.
