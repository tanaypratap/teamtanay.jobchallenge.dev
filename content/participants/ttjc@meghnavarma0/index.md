Hi! I am Meghna, please help me walk you through my profile :)

### introduction

I am currently pursuing bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering and will be completing graduation in the year 2021. In order to be done with some good projects, I am learning web development.

## why are you taking this challenge?

To come out of the comfort zone of completing one project in two months and increase my productivity so that I end up being better every single day!

## something interesting about you?

I have much interest in sketching, cooking, singing, dancing, teaching and practicing problem solving on HackerRank!

### help I need?

It would be great if someone helps me on how I can keep myself motivated to complete five projects within deadline ie. **June 30th**.
