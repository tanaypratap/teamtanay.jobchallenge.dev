Hi! I am Meghna, please help me walk you through my profile :)

### introduction

I am currently pursuing bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering and will be completing graduation in the year 2021. In order to be done with some good projects, I am learning web development.

## why are you taking this challenge?

To come out of the comfort zone of completing one project in two months and increase my productivity so that I end up being better every single day!

## something interesting about you?

I have much interest in sketching, cooking, singing, dancing, teaching and practicing problem solving on HackerRank!

### help I need?

It would be great if someone helps me on how I can keep myself motivated to complete five projects within deadline ie. **June 30th**.

### projects

These are some of the small projects I've built in the past few months:

My projects:

#### Tell Me This

This is a react based qusetion-answer game that gives your report in the end.

- You can find it [here](https://tellmethis.netlify.app/)
- Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/meghnavarma0/react-quiz-app)

#### Book-List

This, again, is a react based application, where I got to learn about context-api and its amazing combo with react hooks. This project uses local-strorage to retain book-data even after a refresh.

- You my find it [here](https://bookread.netlify.app/)
- Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/meghnavarma0/booklist)

#### Youtube Clone

Again, a react application where I got to learn about fetching and receiving data asynchronously via the youtube-API.

- You may find it [here](https://myyoutubeclone.netlify.app/)
- Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/meghnavarma0/react-youtube-clone)

#### Movie Magic

In the react project, I got to learn about react-hooks and build better concepts regarding async-await. I tried to play a little bit with CSS though ;)

- You can see it [here](https://moviemagicsearch.netlify.app/)
- Github repo to this can be found [here](https://github.com/meghnavarma0/movie-magic)

#### Burger Builder

I'll be frank about this. I built it prior to the job challenge following a Udemy course. It is a full-fledged react project which helped me build my basics aroud web development with react.

- You may witness it [here](https://myburgermaker.netlify.app/)
- Github repo to this can be found [here](https://github.com/meghnavarma0/BurgerBuilder)

### blogs

I never thought that blog-writing could be fun, but, it really was :)

#### What in earth do these .call(), .apply() and .bind() methods do ?

I really enjoyed documenting it... I've tried my best to make it interesting to read for beginner programmers.

It can be found [here](https://backtwobasics.vercel.app/call-apply-bind/)

#### Capturing and Bubbling ? No! Bungee Jumping

Lame caption, I know, but the content is relatable. I've tried to relate concepts with real-life fundas.

It can be found [here](https://backtwobasics.vercel.app/event-capturing-bubbling/)

#### Parameters ? Arguments ? Were they ever different ?

When I started learning to code, I struggled a lot in understanding the difference between the two. So, I thought, I shoud try explaining the difference my own way!
