👨‍💻Hello, my name is Sushil.
I'm a Developer and a self taught Designer. The overlap of design and development has always been fascinating for me since the beginning and that's when I decided to follow my passion and take a leap in this field!

### introduction

> _"If you can do what you do best and be happy, you are further along in life than most people"_ - **Leonardo Dicaprio**

This quote from Leonardo really resonated with me, I've always had a passion for brainstorming and making about products. I've got the ability to pick up things quickly and that has made me an avid problem solver and a quick learner.

### what am I learning

Currently I'm working on procuring depth in `ReactJS` `Javascript` and then moving onto learning `NodeJS` and `databases`. I've Invested my time learning `Gastby` and I ended up making my [Portfolio Website ](https://sushilburagute.github.io/)on it!

Apart from coding the web, I'm also into UI/UX and I've made a concept UX for Instagram and Whatsapp, while highlighting the problems faced by the users! [Check it here on Instagram.](https://instagram.com/sushil.buragute)

Whenever I'm not coding or subconsciously thinking of an Design, I'm either preparing for a hackathon or helping people code on _#teamTanay_. I've taken a couple of webinars for PCCOER's ACM chapter and look forward to giving more talks on my learning!

## why are you taking this challenge?

⚡ I want to procure knowledge about building full fledged Web-Apps and what makes a product tick with the end user. The job challenge is the perfect platform to put your work out there and interact with the #teamTanay community while doing it!

_(Also the factor where I like to build new projects and solve problems to get a daily dose of Dopamine and Serotonin)_

## something interesting about you?

I've got quick reflexes and the ability to understand concepts quickly. So whenever it comes to athletics or playing a FPS game like CSGO, I squish the competition. Also I'm fond of Chess, it really pushes my mind to think of the future moves possible and that eventually reflects in my work, thinking a couple of steps ahead to solve problems which will later arise.

### help I need?

It would be nice to know about Software Engineering skills, Development Cycle, and finally building full fledged polished Web-apps.
