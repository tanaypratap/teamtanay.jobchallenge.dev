üë®‚ÄçüíªHello, my name is Sushil.
I'm a Developer and a self taught Designer. Overlap of design and development has always been fascinating for me since the beginning and that's when I knew I had to do something here.

### introduction

"If you can do what you do best and be happy, you are further along in life than most people" - Leonardo Dicaprio

This quote from Leonardo really resonated with me, I've always had a passion for making and building amazing products. I view myself as a multi-talented person. And I spend most of my time learning and keeping a tab on emerging trends in the everchanging tech world.Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, I'm easily inspired and more than willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me. I'm a passionate, expressive, multi-talented spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire!

## why are you taking this challenge?

‚ö° I want to procure knowledge about building full fledged Web-Apps and what makes a product tick with the end user.
(Also the factor where I like to build new projects and solve problems to get a daily dose of Dopamine and Serotonin)

## something interesting about you?

I've got quick reflexes and the ability to understand concepts quickly. So whenever it comes to athletics or playing a FPS game, I squish the competition.

### help I need?

It would be nice to know about Software Engineering skills, Development Cycle, and finally building full fledged polished Web-apps.
