Hi! I am Vikrant Bhat, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am an Engineering Student and I have a keen interest in software development. I'm a self-taught ReactJS front-end Developer. I spend most of my time converting ideas into code. I enjoy learning new languages and skills from online courses. Besides work, I love to go swimming on a sunny day.
<shout> Some curious coding and cleverness </shout>

## why are you taking this challenge?

I want to test my maximum capability of creating awesome projects and writing blogs (which I haven't ever written before) in the specified tight timeline.
Also, would like to make connections with people having a similar coder mindset :)

## something interesting about you?

Well, I played Nationals in Football (U-17), How many coders can say that?

### help I need?

It would be awesome if someone can guide me how to make my development level code ready for **production** with industry standards.

### projects

not a lot of projects are done. I will keep updating it with real links when done.

My projects:

_stack_ Made in React with hooks and context. This is written in typescript. Backend is powered by Express and MongoDB.
