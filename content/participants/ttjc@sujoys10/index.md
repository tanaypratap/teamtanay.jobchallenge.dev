Hi! Myself Sujoy Saha, a javascript developer, currently working in Cognizant as a LIMS consultant.

### introduction

I had graduated in 2018. My stream was ECE. 
My coding journey hadn't started smooth. I had literally struggled in coding in most part of my college and even started thinking about non-technical job.
And then Javascript happend. It gave me confidence, belief that I can also build things. I made Golazo and
got my first job with it. Now The sailor is on the voyage of knowing the unknowing.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I want to build some cool stuffs.

## something interesting about you?

Business. Football. Cricket. Politics. Social Issue - A good speaker and a better listener.
