Hi! I am Bharath working in a startup, I have got 2years of professional work exprerience. Let me walk you through my journey so far.

### introduction

I am a software developer wth 2 years of expertise in java and backend technologies. I have worked in one of the MNC's for close to 1.6 years and moved to startup recently.


## why are you taking this challenge?

During my complete experience I haven't got a chance to work on any of the current front end technologies. Seeing so much of expertise in this team for UI, I thought this would be best place to learn frontend which gives me a chance to stand as a FULL Stack Developer.

## something interesting about you?

I am 24 and I enjoy playing Dj.

### help I need?

help me add Frontend technologies to my Tech stack.

### how to contact me?

### projects

I haven't done any projects  yet, apart for the ones that i worked on within the companies.

I will start sharing my personal projects with live links and source code links after I finish implementing them.

### blogs

I will start sharing my blogs with live links after I finish writing them.
