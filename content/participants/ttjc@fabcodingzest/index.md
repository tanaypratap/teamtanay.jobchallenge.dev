Hi! I am a Fabeha Rizvi, let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am a 3rd year student pursuing BCA from Indira Gandhi National Open University.
I started guiding myself to learn web development in 2019 with the help of online resources which is still going good. I am determined to become a good developer one day and hence thriving to improve each day.
An optimistic person who believes anything can happen if you believe and work hard for it, I am always excited to learn new things and make progress every day.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship or job by the start of 2021, by the time I finish my Graduation .
I want to improve my existing skills and learn new ones in the real industry and hence this challenge will help me grow.
I participated in hackoctoberfest too but that was my first time so couldn't work on good projects because of my lack of skills.
I hope to push myself to learn and build things which I am weak at, even if I don't win there is nothing to lose but earn. 

## something interesting about you?

I don't think anything is interesting in me ðŸ˜‚ but I can figure problems(small computer things) out myself if I really want to rest I am a lazy person unless I have true motivation.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone could really guide me on how to structure and plan for projects.
