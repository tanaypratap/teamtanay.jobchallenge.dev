Hi! I am Digvijay, MERN stack developer.

### introduction

Hi! I am Digvijay, a 15 y/o from Jodhpur, Rajasthan. MERN is my staple tech stack. All I have learnt till now is self taught. Web dev has empowered me to create something that solves problem and that's what I have did with all of my projects.

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need an internship to have some experience of writing code on scale helping a number of users, which will ultimately let me learn and explore more in my niche.

## something interesting about you?

As a 15 year old I always think my next project will be a billion dollar startup.

### help I need?

It would be highly appreciated if I am provided with some help for learning to work with MongoDB or nosql databases.

### projects

I am working on a couple of projects. Some of them  are solving my own itch and a few I observed others struggling with. I will keep updating the links here.

### blogs

I love writing my experiences and sharing them up. As soon as I complete the projects, I will start updating my blog.
