Hi! I am Aditya Raj, a first-year b.tech dropout self-learning web development. Let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs 

### introduction

I have always been fascinated by the way web works and wanted to learn what goes under the hood but been stuck in the race of go-to-college then get a job. But as soon as I found out that I am not getting enough value after paying the college in bulks, I dropped out and started learning web development, making web apps and learn the PRACTICAL skills I always wanted to. A passionate learner ready to speak in public and accept challenges head on.  

## why are you taking this challenge?

I need a job so that I can quickly level up my skills by working with some highly creative people in the industry and provide value with my skillset.

## something interesting about you?

I am a shayar in my free time and have saved many of my friends relationships and played a hand in few of their breakups too.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone helps me with building backends using latest techs like Hashura or AWS amplify and working properly with databases.
