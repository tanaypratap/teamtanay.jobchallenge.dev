Hi! I am a Nikhil Namal let me walk you through my intro, projects and blogs.

### introduction

I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering and will graduate in June 2020. The Web is exciting and has a really enthusiastic developer community. A little more than a year ago I started learning about it because I wanted to build something that is future orientated and easily accessible. Since then I have been continually teaching myself about it.

## why are you taking this challenge?

Taking this challenge to get Job.
Also, I want to learn and improve my skills.

## something interesting about you?

I'm a memer and I love making memes.

### help I need?

It would be good if someone can guide me how to write and maintain production level code.
